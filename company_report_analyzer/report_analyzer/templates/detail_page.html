            <p class="my-2"><span class="special-text">Company Report Analyzer</span> is an application that processes a data file in a few clicks and produces the requested reports. To demonstrate the capabilities of this application, I used a test data file and created 8 possible test reports. The test result is of no value at all. But in the real world, the value and potential of this application is limitless. Therefore, I urge you not to look at this application</p>
            <p class="my-2"><span class="special-text">through the prism of a test task...</span></p>
            <p class="my-2">In the real world (if the application is modified and customized to the needs of a specific company), this application will be able to process <span class="special-text">ANY</span> file with company data.</p>
            <p class="my-2">And not necessarily just one data file (as shown in the example). When modified, the application can expect and accept any number of files and create any number of desired reports for each type (<span class="special-text">not just 8 as shown in the example</span> ).</p>
            <p class="my-2"><span class="special-text">All Excel files of the company</span> (such as sales reports, comparative reports, activity forecasts, transaction reports, etc.) can be processed and analyzed by the application (subject to its modification) and the results can be not only in the form of pdf files with graphs, but <span class="specila-text">in any format</span> (Excel, CSV, etc.)</p>
            <p class="my-2">
              At the same time,  <span class="special-text">from the user's side,everything will look as elementary</span> as in the test example: a few steps (selecting a file, selecting reports, and clicking on the processing button) and voila. The desired result.
            </p>
            <h2 class="my-4">Let's sum it up: <span class="special-text">What the final stage of the application might look like?</span></h2>
            <ul>
              <li>1. The application accepts any company file (possibly organizes and processes it)</li>
              <li>2. Based on the file content, the application offers a huge number of reports from which the user selects what interests him at the moment</li>
              <li>3. The result is presented in any form that the user needs (pdf, excel, csv)</li>
              <li>4. The user does not need to configure anything and understand the complex logic of the application. A few clicks and the result is in his hands</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="my-2"><span class="special-text">Isn't it wonderful?</span></p>
            <p class="my-2">If you are interested in implementing such an application in your enterprise or you need something similar, please contact me using this email <span class="special-text">m88bilan@gmail.com</span></p>
